Was looking back through some of my notes and came across this write up I did for a Struts exploit. Nothing crazy but what I liked about the notes I captured was around detection on what defenders could have alerted on when this exploit came out. Enjoy!

Confirmed publicly released exploits of CVE-2017-9791 do allow remote code execution with privileges of the web server.  In recent vulnerabilities involving Struts and others it appears that most business functions follow the best practice of running the web server without admin or root privileges but of course this needs to be confirmed on a case by case basis.

The vulnerable functionality within Struts 2.3.X and below is a sample Struts application that comes bundled by default named struts2-showcase, this application is not installed by default so one would have to intentionally deploy this application.  Below is a screenshot showing it deployed.
