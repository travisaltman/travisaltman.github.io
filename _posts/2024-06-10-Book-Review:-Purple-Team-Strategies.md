Recently got done reading [Purple Team Strategies] (https://www.packtpub.com/product/purple-team-strategies/9781801074292) and wanted to capture my thoughts and takeaways.


Who is this book for?  I think the audience has a broad specrum from those wanting to learn about certain aspects of Purple Teaming to an organization trying to implement a whole service dedicated to Purple Teaming.
