Recently got done reading [Purple Team Strategies](https://www.packtpub.com/product/purple-team-strategies/9781801074292) and wanted to capture my thoughts and takeaways.  The concept of Purple Teaming in cybersecurity comes from the military use of [War Gaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma_I-67_and_II-67_war_games) where they pitted Red teams against Blue teams.  Within cybersecuity we combine these teams, hence Purple, so that defenders can learn from attackers and vice versa.


Who is this book for?  I think the audience has a broad specrum from those wanting to learn about certain aspects of Purple Teaming to an organization trying to implement a whole service dedicated to Purple Teaming.
